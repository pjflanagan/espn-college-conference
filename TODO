- [ ] Add ranking change averages by poll (in an attempt to measure accuracy, Flux)
- [ ] Add college basketball
- [ ] Improve accuracy (the source data was old)

- Flux:
    - Sum:
        - every change in the sidebar
        - team previously NR = 26 - <rank>
        - team dropped from rankings =  26 - <previous rank>
    - Divide that total by 25 and display Flux at the top
	- This could give us a measure of which ranking system is more accurate week after week
